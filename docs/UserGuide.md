# DevTrans User Guide

The DevTrans CLI lets you upload files from any shell and receive a single-use
download link. This guide explains how to install the client with the provided
installer scripts and how to transfer files.

## Requirements

- An upload token generated by an administrator.
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed so the installer scripts can build the
  client binary.
- Optional: set `DEVTRANS_BASE_URL` if the server is not running on
  `http://localhost:8000`.

## Installation

Use the provided installer script for your operating system. Run the commands
from the repository root.

### Linux

```bash
sudo installer/linux_install.sh
```

The script builds the binary, installs it under `/usr/local/bin` and writes your
configuration to `/opt/DevTransClient/config`. You will be prompted for your
token and server URL.

### Windows

Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
./installer/windows_install.ps1 -Token <YOUR_TOKEN> [-BaseUrl http://localhost:8000]
```

The installer places `devtrans.exe` in `Program Files\DevTrans`, adds it to your
`PATH` and writes the configuration to `C:\DevTransClient\config`.

## Configuration

The installers create a configuration file for you. Edit `/opt/DevTransClient/config`
(Windows: `C:\DevTransClient\config`) to change your token or base URL after the
initial setup. The file uses `key=value` pairs:

```
token=YOUR_TOKEN
base_url=http://localhost:8000
```

Environment variables `DEVTRANS_TOKEN` and `DEVTRANS_BASE_URL` override these
values when present.

## Uploading Files

After installation the `devtrans` command is available on your `PATH` (Windows
users may need to restart the terminal). Run `put` with a file path. To upload
the current directory as a ZIP archive use `*`.

```bash
devtrans put path/to/file
devtrans put *      # streams directory as ZIP
```

The tool prints a download code, direct URL and expiry timestamp.

## Downloading Files

Retrieve a file with the `get` command and its code:

```bash
devtrans get CODE
```

Files are saved with their original name. Oneâ€‘time shares are removed after the first successful download.

## Updating the CLI

Check for a newer version with:

```bash
devtrans --update
```

The command downloads the latest binary from the server and replaces the current executable.
After running an upload, the client also notifies you when a new version is available.
You can also fetch the binary manually from `<base_url>/cli/devtrans`.

## Web Dashboard

Open the base URL of the DevTrans server in your browser. Enter your token on
the login page to access the dashboard. From there you can upload files through
the browser and view previously uploaded items. The dashboard also offers a link
to download the current CLI binary.
