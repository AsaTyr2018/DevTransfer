# DevTrans User Guide

The DevTrans CLI lets you upload files from any shell and receive a single-use download link. This guide covers building the binary, configuring your token and transferring files.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/) if you need to build the CLI from source.
- An upload token generated by an administrator.
- Optional: set `DEVTRANS_BASE_URL` if the server is not running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Building the CLI

From the `cli/` directory run:

```bash
cd cli
# Linux / macOS
go build -o devtrans
# Windows
go build -o devtrans.exe
```

This produces the `devtrans` binary in the same folder.

## Configuration

Create `/opt/DevTransClient/config` (Windows: `C:\DevTransClient\config`) with your token and server URL:

```
token=YOUR_TOKEN
base_url=http://localhost:8000
```

Environment variables `DEVTRANS_TOKEN` and `DEVTRANS_BASE_URL` override these settings when present.

## Uploading Files

Run the `put` command with a file path. To upload the current directory as a ZIP archive use `*`.

```bash
./devtrans put path/to/file
./devtrans put *      # streams directory as ZIP
```

The tool prints a download code, direct URL and expiry timestamp.

## Downloading Files

Retrieve a file with the `get` command and its code:

```bash
./devtrans get CODE
```

Files are saved with their original name. Oneâ€‘time shares are removed after the first successful download.

## Web Dashboard

Token holders can also log in at the root URL of the server to upload through the browser and see their previously uploaded files.
